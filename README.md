## Easy to use:
- Download project files (server located in server, client in develop branch)
- Go to project root directory
- Run npm i

## Pre-defined npm scripts

- npm run build -> build project to the build folder. Es-lint will be running before build.
- npm run start -> run webpack dev server and open browser.
- npm run lint -> identify errors found in the code, and generate reports about them.
- npm run lintfix -> it detects errors found in the code and tries to fix them.
- npm run pre -> will format the code to the correct standards.
